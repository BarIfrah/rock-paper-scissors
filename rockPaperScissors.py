I'll give you the text inputs for this program, to make your lives a little easier.
In addition, and to make it simple to you, the input from the user will be an integer:
1 for ROCK
2 for PAPER
3 for SCISSORS
A text input describing the operation is unacceptable and will cost you with points.

A quick reminder of the rules:

ROCK(1) vs SCISSORS(3)   --> ROCK(1) wins
SCISSORS(3) vs PAPER(2)  --> SCISSORS(3) win
PAPER(2) vs ROCK(1)      --> PAPER(2) wins

DO NOT ADD EXTRA OPTIONS (No lizard, no Spock.)
